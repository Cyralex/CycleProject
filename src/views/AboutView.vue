      <h1>Welcome to the Bolivar Cycling Site!</h1>
      <p>
        This page was created in an effort to give citizens of Bolivar and surrounding areas information about cycling routes. Did you know that Bolivar falls in the Osage Plains region? This is a great region for experienced cyclists and beginners alike to find cycling routes and explore the surrounding areas.

      <h2>About the Osage Plains:</h2>
      <p>
        The Osage Plains, a region that spans western Missouri, southeastern Kansas, central Oklahoma, and
        north-central Texas, is named after the Osage Nation, a Midwestern Native American Tribe. 
        Although much of the area is now used for agriculture, it has historically been covered         
        in various tall grasses. You can learn more about the Osage Plains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_Plains">here.</a>
